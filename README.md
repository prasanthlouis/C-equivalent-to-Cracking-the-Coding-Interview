# C Equivalent to Cracking the Coding Interview


So here's my attempt to manually write the solutions provided in Cracking the Coding Interview rather than following the provided Java soltuions.

You can read about my thought process here:

Note: This isn't perfect. I solved the questions by first thinking how to solve it.

Next I read the tips or the algorithms explained to see if there was a better method to do it.

Then I closed the book and tried to implement it myself (No, I didn't look at the code unless I was stuck).
