# C Equivalent to Cracking the Coding Interview


So here's my attempt to solve the questions provided in Cracking the Coding Interview in the C++ programming language rather than following the provided Java solutions.

You can read about my thought process here: http://cppcodinginterview.blogspot.in/

Note: This isn't perfect. I solved the questions by first thinking how to solve it.

Next I read the tips or the algorithms explained to see if there was a better method to do it.

Then I closed the book and tried to implement it myself (No, I didn't look at the code unless I was stuck).
